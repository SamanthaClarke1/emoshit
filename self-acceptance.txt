// Self Acceptance

So many stories of so-called "Self Acceptance"
Hold less flavour than communion wafers
Coated, thickly, in six layers of donut-glaze

By now my pallette has been warped
Adjusted to black coffee and rum
This saccharine taste won't do

No woman is an island
"Self Acceptance" is not a magic spell
And hatred, far too sharp a knife

There's a reason they call our vaginas "axe wounds"
Our breastmilk putrid "swamp water"
Our bodies "mutilated", "twisted", "mannish"

I chose to let myself become sterile
And these words make me almost glad I did
Who knows what they'd call my child?

"Self Acceptance" is a privilege
Of a life with support and freedom
Enough, at least, to keep out their bile
