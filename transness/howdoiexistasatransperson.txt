Someone tell me how I keep existing in a world where my existence is framed as a foreign invasion, and a threat to all that is good.

Tell me why the fuck people still manage to blame trans suicide rates on our "innate insanity", ignoring the insane amounts of fucking stress caused by living in a body so non-normative that your mere biological form is a monstrous threat.

I'll be clear. Transphobia is not really a disagreement on language, a conversation on fairness in sports, laws about access to hormones, or medicinal efficacy.
Those are merely the easiest tools to continue a process of societal exclusion, and the erasure of our existence.

There is no choice for us. I can't take my tits off when I leave for work; nor can I remove my dick or alter my brain chemistry. Even if I wanted to detransition, I couldn't. My body and brain is far more female than it is male. To even attempt would be re entering a psychological torment that has already caused me to attempt to kill myself on three seperate occasions.

Transphobia is a death threat.
