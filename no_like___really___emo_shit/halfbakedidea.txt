visitance

I think it's the sweltering, suffocating, coal-like air of the australian summers that makes my walls bend above me.

It's rolled over the hills of my town these past few weeks; like horsemen of ill omen.
I thought my days were dull before this. Grocery runs and beach trips had almost become the same level of mundanity.
But now, with slick hair stuck with sweat to skin, with streets outside quiet to all but the tired magpie's caw, the idea of a beach trip was worse than mundane.

I've been laying here for what has felt like days.
My altar has sat unlit.
My plants unwatered.
My doorbell un-rung.

Not even a stray waft of incense has visited to improve the simple smells of the room I've been stuck in.
And throughout all of this, the white walls around me have seemed to almost drip.
It started maybe an hour ago- the corners started to droop inwards; once sharp corners of a cube rounded off.
