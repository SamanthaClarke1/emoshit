Measure, mark, measure once more
Align a cut and pause
Perfect craftsman
Imperfect specimen

Cut finally, oh, cut
'tween tendons, trembling
Sever skin, split sinew
Muscle pulls away

Lips so fat
Shape so spoiled
Too round in the corners, see?
Detach, discard

Styrofoam under heat
Fetid fat bubbles away
Blood beads at the seams
Detach, discard
