For you, I'll take it off

For you I'll take it off
The fence around my heart
That makes me feel so tough

When you're sweet I'll never scoff
Even when my thoughts are much more tart
For you I'll take it off

I hold those thoughts, high aloft
But to get anywhere, they must depart
So for you, I'll take them off

I love you mulberry, and how soft
Are your cherry cheeks, and smile smart
I'll dream of you, in quiet loft

I'll never know why I oft
Make us stop, stutter, restart
For you, mulberry, I'll take it off
Because I hold you so high aloft
