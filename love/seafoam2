The tide tickles my toes as I step
Softly through sand
My dad told me once of how
Sea lice
Is just sea life cut up 
By the wind

I sit by the shore and see the setting sun
In all her glory
Bubbles popping, prickling my skin
In all its shame
They enter through my navel, fill my gut
Buzzing, burning foam

It traces around my lungs - but only traces
Pushing through the veins in my neck with a 
Pop!
Enters my mouth and coats my tongue
Swirls behind my sea-glass eyes

"Hold onto this for me"
I can almost hear the sun say
She would never say
She wouldn't want to say

I let it sit there still, brimming against my teeth
Who stand guard, soldiers with shields
And swords too heavy
For poseidon

I don't want to spill it on her
