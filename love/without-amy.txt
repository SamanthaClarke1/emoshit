Seven hundred kilometers away she slept
Head heavy from whiskey and pot
Right here, with nothing more than a pillow I wept
A quiet peace for us- but easy, it is not

Nothing can make my days here pass any quicker
So for now, I'm stuck with my computer's hum
I'll spend each hour with good food, good liquor
Wishing for you to join me- knowing it may not come

I loved you in Sydney,
And I'll love you while I'm here
I'll admit, it's a sad treaty
But it might get us to our next beer

Eight hundred miles away, in my bed I lie
Inside a canopy I once called my own
Perhaps there's no real reason to try
But I want to show you for what this place was known

It's not at all happy I'll admit
But I think this is what it means to love you
To say what made my teenage years so shit
To tell you why I pushed through

I want to pull you through this town
To tell you what burnt that field
I'd show you every farm, now overgrown
And everywhere I learnt to yield

Tonight, I know I'll dream
Of seeing your car pull through main arm
Your shy smile, already starting to gleam
Your head, now nested in my arms

A thousand miles apart we both drift off
I'll go to sleep loving you
In my quiet loft
