Waves lap at the edges of my feet
Sea foam sticks, stains the sides
Somewhere just out of sight is churning
Sea lice, once sea creatures
Carried along by the tide

I sit by the shore and see the setting sun, in all her glory
As the foam climbs around me
Tiny bubbles, popping, pricking my skin
Enter through my navel, and fill my gut
Consuming, buzzing, burning foam

It traces around my lungs - but only traces
It pushes through the veins in my neck
Enters my mouth and coats my tongue
Swirls behind my sea-glass eyes

I know how to hold it
The way my mug "knows" how to hold my tea
I let it sit there, brimming against my teeth
Who stand guard, soldiers with shields faced against Poseidon

I don't want to spill it on her.
