#I'm not sure why I leave bad poems in the folder I put on github for tracking
Tomato plants

Warm night air on new years night
Holds me like a child
Tomato plants, to hear my plight

Yet smattering of red
Reminds me of the mulberry
That fills my head

I don't know why I run
Lay barbed wire, across my heart
Say anything short of "it's done"

I needed to escape her swell
Just needed some air
But it held her, as well

Mosquitoes in the air play cupid
As I see your eyes light
Re ignite inside your head
I'll wonder why I'm so stupid




### ignore this
# As I escape her constant pull
# A deep breath- to try and inhale
# Something other than her
