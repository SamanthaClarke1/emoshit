I loved her for a spring and a summer
A love built on beach rocks, blue skies
A gifted toddler, born to worried parents
His favourite colour - now bumblebee yellow

"I love you"
- His first day of school
"I love you"
- Her clay pigeon

She pulled the shot as our lips touched
Our arms, finding their slots in eachother's spines
The gunpowder smell, the clay falling from the sky
It felt like fireworks back then

He was dead.

And yet the memory of him, so strong
That we kept saving for his college tuition
I think it only made it hurt more to admit
That it was time to put him in the ground
